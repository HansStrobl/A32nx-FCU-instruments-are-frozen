# A32nx-FCU-instruments-are-frozen
A32nx FCU instruments  are frozen
after the stable update from v0.12.1 to v0.12.3. the instruments in the Glareshield (FCU) are no longer available. All the indicator lights are on, and everything is frozen. (see screenshot)
Does anyone have any idea what's causing the problem?
MSFS Version 1.38.2.0
FBW A32nx v0.12.3
